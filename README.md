# Public Programming Performance

## About
Public Programming Performance is an in-class, live collaborative programming experiment. It utilizes VSCode Live Edit and a shared GitHub repo to allow a few volunteer students to code live at the front of the class. This setup not only engages volunteers but also encourages the entire class to participate in the programming process by providing real-time feedback, suggestions, and solutions.

## Experiment Details

### Spring 2024 - "Boaty McLongBoat" ⇒ "Island Archipelago"

#### Description
Starting with a simple "Infinite Worlds" sketch from Experiment 04, this iteration transforms "Boaty McLongBoat"—an infinite boat where users can rearrange deck chairs—into an expansive island archipelago.

#### Features
- **Dynamic Geography**: Islands feature distinct colors and terrains.
- **Navigation**: Users explore the world using arrow keys.
- **Interactivity**: Users can place and move boats in the waters.
- **World Seeding**: The placement of islands and other features is affected by a world seed, ensuring a unique experience for each session.

#### Stretch Goals
- Boats autonomously move around the water.
- Proximity-based transformations where adjacent boats combine into larger vessels.
- Interactive island inhabitants that users can place and will move around.
- Dynamic animations for interactions like placing or removing boats.
- Interactive events triggered by user clicks on islands.

## Participation
All class members are encouraged to contribute during the live coding sessions. Whether suggesting code snippets, debugging, or offering new ideas, everyone's input is valuable. Volunteers can tag in and out, allowing for widespread participation.

## Setup
Instructions for setting up the live coding environment with VSCode Live Edit and accessing the GitHub repository will be provided during class sessions.

## Contributing
